<h4>Oil dough</h4>
<ul type="circle">
 <li> 200 g plain flour</li>
<li> 325 g butter</li>
</ul>
<h4>Water dough</h4>
<ul type="circle">
<li> 250 g plain flour</li>
<li> 1 eggs</li>
<li> 1/2 teaspoon of salt</li>
<li> 100 g of ice water</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Filling:</h4>
<ul type="circle">
<li> 5 eggs</li>
<li> 80 ml milk</li>
<li> 165 ml of water</li>
<li> 80 g caster sugar</li>
<li> Egg tart molds</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>How to make</h3>
<ol>
<li> Put the plain flour, egg, and ice water in the electric food processor.</li>
<li> Mix them until they combine and form a ball.</li>
<li> Cut the chilled butter into small pieces.</li>
<li> Put the butter and flour in an electric food processor. Use the pulse function to mix them until it forms bridges and strands.</li>
<li> Spread a large piece of cling film on the tabletop, sprinkle with some plain flour.</li>
<li> Flatten the water dough and place another piece of cling film on top.</li>
<li> Roll the water dough to form a large square.</li>
<li> Remove the cling film on top of the water dough, place the oil dough in the center and fold the sides of the water dough over the oil dough. Make sure the oil dough is fully covered by the water dough. Flatten it with a rolling pin. (Analogy: Now the dough looks like a sandwich, with the oil dough mirrors the filling of the sandwich, and the water dough mirrors the bread.)</li>
<li> Wrap it in cling film and leave it in the chiller for twenty minutes or until it hardens.</li>
<li> Remove it from the chiller Flatten it with a rolling pin to about 3cm thick. Fold both ends of the dough toward the center like closing a book. (Analogy: Now it resembles a multilayered sandwich.) Place it into the chiller again for 20 minutes.</li>
<li> Repeat the folding process (step 6) three more times.</li>
<li> After the last repetition, flatten the dough to about 3mm thickness. Use a cookie cutter or bowl to cut out pieces of round pastry that are slightly larger than the area of the mold.</li>
<li> Put the cut pastry into a mold. Lightly press the pastry onto the surface of the mold.</li>
<li> Trim the sides with a fork or a blunt knife.</li>
<li> Melt the sugar with water to make a simple syrup. Let it cool.</li>
<li> Beat the eggs for a minute.</li>
<li> Add the milk and syrup to the egg. Mixed well.</li>
<li> Filter the milk liquid twice to remove impurities.</li></li>v
<li> Fill each empty pastry shell up to 70%.</li>
<li> Bake it at 200 degrees C/ 390 degrees F for 15 minutes, then reduce to 180 degrees C / 356 degrees F for another 10 minutes. Leave the oven door ajar for five minutes then remove the egg tarts.</li>
