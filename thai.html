  <div><h2>Thai Fresh Spring Roll </h2>
    <p><img class="left" src="thai1.jpg">       
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul type="circle">
<li>1 package spring roll rice wrappers , found in the Asian foods section at the grocery store</li>
<li>1 package vermicelli rice noodles , found in the Asian foods section at the grocery store</li>
<li>2 mangos , peeled and sliced into thin strips</li>
<li>1 large carrot , peeled and shredded or sliced into thin strips</li>
<li>1 large English cucumber , peeled and thinly sliced</li>
<li>1 pound small, cooked shrimp , deveined, tails removed, or substitute chicken</li>
<li>1 bunch fresh mint leaves</li>
<li>1 bunch fresh basil leaves</li>
<li>1 bunch fresh cilantro 3/4 cup sweet chili sauce</li>
<li>1/3 cup peanut butter , smooth or crunchy</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon low-sodium soy sauce</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon hoisin sauce</li>
<br>
<h3>How to cook</h3>
<ol>
<li>   Cook vermicelli noodles in boiling water, for just a few minutes, according to package instructions. Drain and rinse with cold water.</li>
 <li>Gather all topping ingredients together, including chopped veggies, herbs, cooked shrimp.</li>
<li> Add about 1 inch of water to a large, deep dish, or pie pan. Place one rice wrapper into the water and let soak for just 10-15 seconds. It should still feel pretty firm as you remove it and lay it on your counter or plate. </li>
<li> (It will soften up as you add the filling ingredients, but If you let it soak for too long it will get too soft and will tear when you roll it up.)</li>
<li> Layer 1-2 slices of each veggie, a few shrimp, a few leaves of each herb and a pinch of noodles on the ⅓ of the spring roll that is closest to you.</li>
<li> Fold the sides of the spring roll in over the ingredients. Then pull the side closest to you up and over the ingredients, sealing everything together tightly, and rolling it up like a burrito. </li>
<li> For the sauce, add all ingredients to a food processor or blender and pulse until smooth</li>

<li> 2 to 3 fresh Thai chiles (2 to 3g total), stemmed (see note)</li>
<li> 1 tablespoon (8g) dried shrimp (see note)</li>
<li> 2 tablespoons (30g) roasted unsalted peanuts, divided</li>

<h2>Thai Mango Sticky Rice</h2>
<p>
<img class="left" src="thai6.jpg">       
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul type="circle">
<li> 1½ cups glutinous (sweet) rice</li>
<li> 1⅓ cups well-stirred canned unsweetened coconut milk</li>
<li> ⅓ cup plus 3 tablespoons sugar</li>
<li> ¼ teaspoon salt</li>
<li> 1 tablespoon sesame seeds, toasted lightly</li>
<li> 1 large mango, peeled, pitted, and cut into thin slices (at least 24)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>How to make</h3>
<ol>
<li> In a bowl wash rice well in several changes of cold water until water is clear. Soak rice in cold water to cover overnight.</li>
<li> Drain rice well in a sieve. Set sieve over a large deep saucepan of simmering water (sieve should not touch water) and steam rice, covered with a kitchen towel and a lid, 30 to 40 minutes, or until tender. </li>

<h2>Thai Fried Bananas</h2>
<p>
<img class="left" src="thai7.jpg">       
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<li> 3/4 cup sunflower oil or other neutral frying oil, more as needed</li>
<li> 2 to 4 regular bananas (or 6 to 8 mini sweet bananas)</li>
<li> 1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
<li> 1/4 plus 1/3 cup rice flour, more as needed, divided</li>
<li> 1/4 cup cornstarch</li>
<li> 1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
<li> 3 tablespoons dried shredded unsweetened coconut, more as needed, divided</li>
<li> 1/3 cup cold water</li>
<li> 1/3 teaspoon baking soda</li>
<li> 1 large egg</li>
<li> Few drops vanilla</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>How to make</h3>
<ol>
<li> Heat a wok or skillet with oil about 3/4 to 1-inch deep.</li>
<li> Meanwhile, prepare the bananas by peeling and slicing them in half. Then slice each section in half again, but lengthwise this time.</li>
<li> In a medium mixing bowl, place all-purpose flour, 1/4 cup of rice flour, cornstarch, salt, and 2 tablespoons of the shredded coconut and stir to combine.</li>
<li> In a measuring cup, mix together cold water with baking soda until dissolved and pour into bowl with flour mixture.</li>
<li> Add the egg and the vanilla. Stir well until fully combined.</li>
<li> Place remaining 1/3 cup rice flour in a separate, dry bowl and add remaining one tablespoon shredded coconut. Mix well and set next to the batter.</li>
<li> Dip banana pieces first in the batter, then gently dredge them in the rice flour-coconut mixture. This last step helps firm up the batter and is the secret to creating a crisp, rather than soggy, coating.</li>
<li> Carefully place coated bananas in the hot oil. Fry approximately 1 minute per side, or until batter puffs up slightly and turns light- to medium-golden brown.</li>
<li> Serve your fried bananas as soon as possible as is, or with a side of coconut or vanilla ice cream.</li>
