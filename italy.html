  <div><h2>Pizza (Italian way) </h2>
    <p><img class="left" src="italy1.jpg">       
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul type="circle">
<li> 600ml of warm water</li>
<li> 1kg of flour, the authentic Italian pizzas use type ‘00’ or ‘doppio zero’ flour which is the finest ground flour available in Italy, if this isn’t readily available to yourselves an all-purpose flour will do the same job</li>
<li> 6 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil</li>
<li> 25g of fresh yeast, or around 8g of dried yeast</li>
<li> 5 teaspoons of salt</li>
<li> 2 teaspoons of sugar</li>
<li> Any toppings you want, the classic authentic toppings would be tomato sauce, oregano or basil, salt, garlic and olive oil, although you can layer your dough with whatever you desire.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>How to cook</h3>
<ol>
<li> Sprinkle the fresh or dried yeast into a bowl filled with warm water. Yeast reacts best with warm water so ensure it isn’t too hot or too cold.</li>
<li> Pour the flour into a pile on the table and make a groove in the top so the flour resembles a volcano.</li>
<li> Pour the yeast mixture along with the olive oil, salt and sugar into the groove of the flour.</li>
<li> Combine all the ingredients by kneading the mixture for 10-15 minutes. Ensure that the surface remains floured throughout the kneading process.</li>
<li> Grease a bowl with some olive oil and place the ball of dough inside, turning it over once placed to make sure the top of the dough is oiled.</li>
<li> Cover the bowl and leave to prove for at least four hours. Preheat the oven to around 200°C.</li>
<li> Remove the dough from the bowl onto your floured surface and punch it down to remove all air bubbles from within the dough.</li>
<li> Divide the dough into quarters and leave to rest for a few minutes.</li>
<li> Roll each section into a 12-inch disc, deciding on how thick or thin you would like your crust to be.</li>
<li> Move the rolled-out dough onto an oiled baking sheet or pan.</li>
<li> Add tomato sauce and brush the edges of the crust with olive oil and bake for 10 minutes. Many pizzas in Italy are actually pizza Bianca, which means the base has no tomato sauce on it, so if you would prefer it without, then just brush the crust with oil and bake.</li>
<li> Once the baked crust comes out of the oven, you can then add all your toppings and mozzarella cheese.</li>
<li> Place the pizza back into the oven until the crust has browned and the cheese has melted. To make sure your pizza is done, check the base to see whether that has browned too.</li>
<li> Remove the pizza from the oven, garnish with basil leaves and enjoy!</li>

Remove to a board, cover, and rest, pouring pan juices over the potatoes.</li>

<h2>Panettone</h2>
<p>
<img class="left" src="italy7.jpg">       
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul type="circle">
<li> 4 tbsp warm milk</li>
<li> 1 x 7g sachet fast-action dried yeast</li>
<li> 150g caster sugar</li>
<li> 250g butter, softened</li>
<li> 5 medium eggs, lightly beaten</li>
<li> 2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
<li> grated zest of 1 lemon</li>
<li> grated zest of 1 orange</li>
<li> 550g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
<li> 80g raisins</li>
<li> 80g sultanas</li>
<li> 3 tbsp dark rum</li>
<li> 100g good-quality candied lemon and orange peel, finely chopped</li>
</ul>
<h3>For the topping</h3>
<ul type="circle">
  <li> 30g whole blanched almonds, roughly chopped</li>
<li> 1 tbsp caster sugar</li>
<li> 1 tbsp egg white</li>
<li> 1 tbsp icing sugar</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>How to make</h3>
<ol>
<li> Grease a panettone tin (see Tip) or a 20cm deep cake tin, or use a panettone case.</li>
<li> Place the warm milk in a bowl and add the yeast and 1 tsp of sugar and leave for a few minutes.</li>
<li> Put the remaining sugar in a large bowl and beat together with the butter and vanilla extract until really light, creamy and pale.</li>
<li> Stir in the lemon and orange zest. Add the eggs a little at a time until all are well incorporated. Spoon in a tablespoon of the flour if the mixture starts to curdle and beat this in with the eggs.</li>
<li> Place the flour in a large bowl and mix with a good pinch of salt and make a well in the centre. Add the yeast mixture then the butter and egg mixture, folding in with a large spoon to make a soft dough. Knead for 5 mins in the bowl until it all starts to come together. It will be a pretty sticky dough at this stage.</li>
<li> Turn out the dough onto a floured surface and knead for a further 10 mins, until everything has come together and you have a very soft and stretchy dough. Add a light sprinkling of flour to the surface and your hands as you go to stop the mixture sticking, but try not to add too much. Place in a lightly greased bowl and cover. Place in the fridge overnight to prove.</li>
<li> Place the raisins and sultanas in a small saucepan with the rum and heat gently for 5 – 7 mins until the fruit has absorbed the liquid and is plump and juicy. Set aside to cool.</li>
<li> When the dough is risen, tip it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for another 5 mins. Gradually knead in the soaked raisins, sultanas and chopped candied peel. Shape the dough into a ball and pop into the prepared tin. If using a 20cm cake tin, wrap a layer of baking parchment around the outside of the tin, to come up about 5cm above the rim, and secure the paper with string. This will help contain the dough as it rises. Cover lightly with cling film and leave to rise for 3-4 hours depending on your room temperature, until it has doubled in size.</li>
<li> Preheat the oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4. Adjust the oven shelf to the right height. Mix together the almonds, caster sugar and egg white for the topping and gently brush over the top of the panettone. Place in the oven and bake for 40 - 50 mins until golden and risen and a skewer comes out clean when inserted into the middle of the cake. Leave to cool in the tin for 10 mins before turning out onto a wire rack. Leave to cool completely before dusting lightly with icing sugar and cutting into wedges to serve.</li>

<h2>Cannoli Sicilian</h2>

    <li> 500 g (18 oz) sheep’s milk ricotta</li>
<li> 180 g (6 oz) of white sugar</li>
<li> 60 g (2 oz) of dark chocolate drops</li>
<li> chopped pistachios, candied fruit and icing sugar for decoration</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to make</h3>
<ol>
<li> Start making Sicilian cannoli recipe by placing the flour in a large bowl.</li>
<li> Add acing sugar, cinnamon, unsweetened cocoa powder, coffee powder and fine salt.</li>
<li> Mix with a wooden spoon then add lard or butter (at room temperature), depending on what you have chosen as an ingredient.</li>
<li> Add the egg and stir, mixing the ingredients.</li>
<li> Finally add the masala wine then with your hands begin to knead the ingredients.</li>
<li> Wrap it in a kitchen film, then let it rest in the fridge for about 30 minutes.</li>
<li> Now take out the Sicilian cannoli dough from the fridge and roll it out with a rolling pin up to a thickness of about 3 mm, then, with a pastry ring (or a cup) of 10 or 12 cm (4 or 5 inch) in diameter , make some cannoli disks.</li>
<li> Gently remove the disc from the work surface and wrap it around the cannoli tube.</li>
<li> Wet the ends of the disk with a little cold water and press well to close it. This will prevent the cannoli from opening during cooking.</li>
<li> Fry the cannoli for one or two minutes in plenty of peanut oil. As soon as the dough becomes golden, remove from the oil, drain on paper towels, and let cool. Finally remove the cannoli from the tubes.</li>
<li> Place the ricotta in a bowl and add the sugar then stir and mix the two ingredients.</li>
<li> Now add the chocolate drops, mix well and store in the fridge till the moment to serve.</li>
<li> Let’s start with filling a pastry bag with the ricotta and chocolate cream</li>
<li> Take the cannoli (which in the meantime you will have kept at room temperature) and fill them with cream with the help of the pastry bag, Then decorate them with chopped pistachios</li>
<li> Place the Sicilian cannoli in a serving dish, sprinkle with icing sugar and serve.</li>
